## Indexing Time

type | algorithms
--- | ---
without-index algorithms | bprw, isp(10) 
with-index algorithms | flpmc and bflpmc, sling(16), linearD(14), cloud-walker(15), and tsf(15)

algorithm | indexing content 
--- | ---
our reduced-local-push | 1. P (estimate), 2. R (residual)
sling | 1. compute d_k (MC), 2. h_k^l (stored into p), 3. also `first`/`second` flag arrays
linearD | 1. compute d_{k,k}, 2. P 3. PT 
cloud-walker | 1. compute d_{k,k}    
tsf | 1. one-way-graphs
